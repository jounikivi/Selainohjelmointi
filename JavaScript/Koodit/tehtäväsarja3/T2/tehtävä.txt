2. Object destructuring. (4 * 0,25 = 1 point)
You have the following object.
const musician = {
  name: 'Sting',
  realName: 'Gordon Matthew Thomas Sumner’,
  instrument: {
    type: 'bass'
  }
};
Use object destructuring to do the following assignments.
a. Read the attributes name and instrument into the variables name and instrument.
b. Read the attributes name and instrument into the variables nameOfArtist and instumentOfArtist.
c. Read the type of the instrument into a variable instrumentTypeOfArtist.
d. Read the make of the instrument into a variable instrumentMakeOfArtist. If the attribute is missing from the current object, give it a default value “unknown”.
